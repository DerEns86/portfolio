    <h2 translate>disclaimer</h2>
    § 1 <span translate>content warning</span><br />
    <span translate>The free and freely accessible content of this website has been created with the greatest possible
        care. The provider of this website assumes no responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of the free and
        freely accessible free and freely accessible journalistic guides and news. Contributions identified by name
        reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Simply by calling up
        free and freely accessible content does not constitute a contractual relationship between the user and the
        provider. In this respect, the provider's intention to be legally bound is lacking.</span><br />
    <br />
    § 2 <span translate>external links</span><br />
    <span translate>This website contains links to third-party websites (external links). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the third-party content for any legal violations. No legal violations were apparent at that time. The provider has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. The provider cannot reasonably be expected to constantly monitor external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, such external links will be deleted immediately if we become aware of any legal violations.</span><br />
    <br />
    § 3 <span translate>copyrights</span><br />
    <span translate>The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright law. Any use not permitted by German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or respective rights holder. This applies in particular to the duplication, editing, translation, storage, processing or reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Third-party content and rights are identified as such. The unauthorized reproduction or distribution of individual contents or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable by law. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private and non-commercial use is permitted.</span><br />
    <br />
    <span translate>The presentation of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.</span><br />
    <br />
    § 4 <span translate>Special terms of use</span><br />
    <span translate>Insofar as special conditions for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly indicated at the appropriate point. In this case, the special terms of use apply in each individual case.</span>
